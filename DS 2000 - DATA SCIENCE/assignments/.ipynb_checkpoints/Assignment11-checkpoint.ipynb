    "This homework includes some repeated task and variations on model fitting, and model comparision, which should prepare you optimally for the final. Try to solve the task in the homework independently, and prepare a cheat-sheet and a file with useful functions, such that you can complete this homework in 3 hrs or less. \n",

    "## Data set \n",
    "The file babies.csv contains data from the Child Health and Development Studies, which investigate a range of topics. One study considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. Here, we look at the predictor of birth weight of babies, measured in ounces, as well as the occurence of complications in the first 3 month. \n",

    "- parity:        1: child the first born 0: Child has older siblings \n",
    "- age:           Age of the mom at time of birth\n",

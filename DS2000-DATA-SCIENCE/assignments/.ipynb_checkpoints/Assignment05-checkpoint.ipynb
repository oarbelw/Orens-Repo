    "# Assignment 5: Randomization test 2\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "We will continue our last homework on the use of randomization and Monte-Carlo simulation tests to determine whether a specific effect is statistically significant. Randomization and simulation tests are universal and powerful way to do this, and form an essential part of the toolkit of any Data Scientist. \n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "In Task 1 & 2, we continue with the movie dataset. The first two task build on the last homework and run randomization tests with two new test statistics. You should re-use the randomization test function that you wrote for the last homework – but the new modified version needs to be included in the submission. In Task 3 you are asked to program a simple monte-Carlo simulation test.  \n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "Set up the environment by importing pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Load the movie data set into a pandas data frame. **IMPORTANT: Download and used the new movie data set that comes with this assignment on OWL**. Because we are using plots make sure that you configure your notebook such that plots are shown inline (see Assignment 2). "

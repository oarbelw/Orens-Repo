    "Start with the function code that you wrote in homework 7. Modify the function simpleRegLossRSS to calculate the summed absolute deviation of the prediction from the data (instead of the residual sum-of-squares). Call this new function simpleRegLossSAD. Modify your simpleRegFit function (Task 3, Question 4) from Homework 7 to take a flexible loss function as a 3rd input argument. Now call the function with your new loss function to calculate a regression line of tailL (y) against age (x) in the possum data set (see HW7). Your function simpleRegFit  should provide a plot of the fit. Compare the fit with the fit you achieved with the squared error (HW7, task 3, question 5). What do you observe?"

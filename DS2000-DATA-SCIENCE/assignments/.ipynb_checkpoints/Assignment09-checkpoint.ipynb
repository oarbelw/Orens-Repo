    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "This assignment introduces you to multiple regression analysis, model comparision between different multiple regression models and bootstrap for regression models. \n",
    "### Data set \n",
    "An investigator is interested in understanding the relationship, if any, between the analytical skills of young gifted children and the following variables: father’s IQ, mother’s IQ, age in month when the child first said ‘mummy’ or ‘daddy’, age in month when the child first counted to 10 successfully, average number of hours per week the child’s mother or father reads to the child, average number of hours per week the child watched an educational program on TV during the past three months, average number of hours per week the child watched cartoons on TV during the past three months. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analytical skills are evaluated using a standard testing procedure, and the score on this test is used as the response variable. Data were collected from schools in a large city on a set of thirty-six children who were identified as gifted children soon after they reached the age of four.\n",
    " \n",
    "The data frame stored in gifted.csv contains the variables: \n",
    "- score:       Score in test of analytical skills.\n",
    "- fatheriq:    Father’s IQ.\n",
    "- motheriq:  Mother’s IQ.\n",
    "- speak:       Age in months when the child first said ‘mummy’ or ‘daddy’.\n",
    "- count:       Age in months when the child first counted to 10 successfully.\n",
    "- read:         Average number of hours per week the child’s mother or father reads to the child.\n",
    "- edutv:       Average number of hours per week the child watched an educational program on TV during the past three months.\n",
    "- cartoons:  Average number of hours per week the child watched cartoons on TV during the past three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminaries\n",
    "Set up the environment by importing pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, scipy.optimize. This is already done in the preliminaries. Ensure that you have fully mastered and understood HW7 before starting the assignment. \n"

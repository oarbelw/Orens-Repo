You are allowed to use any document and source on your computer and look up documents on the internet. You or not allowed to share documents, or communicate in any other way with people inside or outside the class room during the midterm. To finish the midterm in the alloted 2 hrs, you will have to work fast and efficiently. Good luck!\n",
